Therefore, we can observe an explosion of Type I error chance of occuring in the set of comparison. \n","\n","To adjust p-value, we must base $\\alpha$ on $\\alpha^*$, $\\alpha^*$ definition varies between methods, but usuall it defines significance level that projects the error rate of the entire sets of comparison.\n","\n","#### **Method 1: Bonferroni-correction**\n","Here we define $\\alpha^*$ as $Pr(False\\ Positive\\ge1)$ or Family Wise Error Rate (FWER), which in this case 0.05. This is done by simply dividing $\\alpha$ with n number of comparison. If we have 3 then $\\alpha$ for each fomparison is 0.0167, meaning that in each comparison it needs p-value < 0.0167 to be able to reject H0.\n","$$\n","\\begin{align*}\n","  (1-\\alpha)^n &= 1-\\alpha^*\\\\\n","  \\alpha &= 1-(1-\\alpha^*)^{1/n} \\le \\alpha^*/n\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$\n","\n","**Weakness:**\n","Too conservative, therefore significantly increases the Type II error (False Negative) rate.\n","\n","#### **Method 2: Benjamini-Hochberg-correction**\n","BH-correction control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) instead of FWER. In this approach, we set $\\alpha^*$ as the expected FDR threshold.\n","$$\n","\\begin{align*}\n","  \\mathbb{E}(\\frac{False\\ Positive}{False\\ Positive + True\\ Positive}) \\le FDR = \\alpha^*\n","\\end{align*}\n","$$\n","Therefore, $\\alpha^*$ now means that for n pairs of comparison,  we're willing to accept up to $\\alpha^*$% of significant results being false positives.\n","BH-correction follows this steps:\n","* Get the original p-value\n","* Sort pair comparison by p-value ascending\n","* Rank each comparison with k=1 for min(p-value) and k=n for max(p-value)\n","* Calculate adj-p-value with:<br/>\n","    adj-p-value $= n/k \\cdot$ p-value\n","\n","**Which approach to use?**\n","\n","Simply: If we can't have any false positive, then choose to
